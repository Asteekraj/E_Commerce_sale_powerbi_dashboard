Interactive dashboards in Power BI are a powerful way to visualize and explore data, making it easier for users to gain insights and make data-driven decisions.


In this dashboard, I have used three tables and connect those using all to one technique, connecting all is helpful to creating a interactive dashboard easily..

ecommerce_data(2) connected with us_state_long_lat _codes----> customer_state --name

ecommerce_data(2) connected with Calender ----> order_date --date
